# Hyperbolic Multi Organ Segmentation
---

## Abstract

Medical image segmentation is important for diagnosing diseases and planning treatments. However, traditional methods in **Euclidean space** struggle with complex organ structures. In this project, we use **Hyperbolic** methods rather Euclidean to improve **multi-organ segmentation**. Hyperbolic space helps represent complex relationships between organs more effectively than Euclidean space. We are testing on **AMOS(Abdominal Multi-Organ Benchmark for Versatile Medical Image Segmentation)** dataset and comparing segmentation performance and computational costs.
